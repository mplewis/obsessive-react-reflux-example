# WIP

I learn by example. When I wanted to learn React and Flux, I spent too many hours learning the modern JS toolbox - webpack is a box of black magic and Gulp is the new Grunt and *what year is it?*

I'm taking my single-page app, [json2pojo](https://github.com/mplewis/json-pojo-frontend), and turning it into an example app that's obsessively commented.

# Goals

* Show the purpose behind every line of code is clear and obvious
* Expose the hidden magic of webpack and loaders
* Demonstrate a working, simple React app architecture built on Reflux
